        question: 'How much does a Teams subscription cost?',
        answer: 'Contributors are members of your team who need access to use the Mac app to create and edit Sketch documents. These prices don’t include sales tax, which may still apply. Head over to our pricing page to get full details.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Do I still need to purchase licenses for the Mac app?',
        answer: 'Yes, each team member who needs access to the Mac app for creating and editing documents will require an individual license. This applies to Contributors, as they are users who actively work within the app. The licenses are managed through the Teams subscription, allowing centralized control and billing.'
    },
    {
        question: 'What are the differences between Contributors and Viewers?',
        answer: 'Contributors are team members who can use the Mac app to create, edit, and manage files. They have full editing permissions. Viewers, on the other hand, have limited access—they can only view files shared with them, make comments, and provide feedback, but they cannot make any edits or changes to the documents.'
    },
    {
        question: 'How long does the free Teams subscription trial last?',
        answer: 'The free trial for a Teams subscription lasts for 30 days. During this period, you’ll have full access to all the features of the Teams plan, allowing you to evaluate its suitability for your organization before committing to a paid subscription.'
    },
    {
        question: 'Will the program for Teams replace volume licensing?',
        answer: 'Yes, the Teams program is designed to streamline the licensing process by providing a centralized subscription model. Instead of purchasing individual licenses for each team member, the Teams program allows you to manage all users under a single subscription, which simplifies billing, license distribution, and user management.',
